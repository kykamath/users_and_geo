Modeling:
	1. Steps to create a city:
		=> Add locations - With visitation probability distribution, estimated from some cities.
						The probability decides how many people are going to visit a location.
						Ex: Airport has a higher probability than a bar.
						   Also with periodicity of visit probability distribution.
						Ex: A bar is visited 2-3 times a week. Airport is visited once every 
						10 weeks.
							Also day timeSpecific probability distribution.
						Ex: Cafe sees more people in the evening than in the afternoon.
		=> Add users - With location specific probability. This is determined by the cluster
						a user belongs to.
						Ex. Moms go to Walmart in the morning, students go in the evenings.
		=> Assign users to locations: Number of locations is based on parameters estimation, and
						the probability of adding a particular location is dependent on the 
						locations probability.

	1. Types of location selection: Random, Prefix methods
